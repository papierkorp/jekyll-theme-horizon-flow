# Getting Started with Jekyll

Jekyll is a static site generator that allows you to create beautiful websites easily. In this post, we will explore the basics of getting started with Jekyll. We'll cover installation, folder structure, and how to create your first Jekyll site.

## Installation

To install Jekyll, you need to have Ruby installed on your system. Once Ruby is installed, you can install Jekyll using the following command:

gem install jekyll

shell
Copy code

## Folder Structure

A typical Jekyll site has the following folder structure:

```bash
_config.yml
_layouts
default.html
_posts
_site
index.md
sql
```

## Creating Your First Site

To create your first Jekyll site, navigate to the folder where you want to create the site and run the following command:

jekyll new mysite
cd mysite
jekyll serve

less
Copy code

You can then access your site at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

That's it! You're now ready to start building your Jekyll site.
